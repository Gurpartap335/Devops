How did it start ?

ICP : Internet Service provider
Ip : Internet protocol
www : world wide web

protocol ::
a system of fixed rules and formal behaviour used at official meetings , usually between governments .


Computer Network is a group of computers connected with each other through wires , 
optical fibres or optical links so that various device can interact with each other through a network .

Types of Computer networks
WAN (wide area network)
MAN (metropolitan area network)
LAN
PAN (personal area network)

Computer networks :
LAN (Local area network)
PAN (personal)
MAN(Metropolitan)
WAN(Wide)

LAN ::
Building , office , school

PAN :: is a computer network formed around a person .
10m range 

MAN ::
larger geographic area by interconnecting a different LAN to form a larger network .
Government agencies use MAN to connect to the citizens and private industries .

WAN : is a network that extends over a large geographical area such as states or countries .

Network components >>
End Devices > PC , Laptop , Mobile
Connecting Devices > hubs , switches , routers 
Transmission media > wired , wireless media 
Software > operating system 


Major components of a computer network are :
NIC (National interface card) is a device that helps the computer to communicate with another device .

Hub
Hub is a central device that splits the network connection into multiple devices .

Switches :
switch is a networking device that groups all the devices over the network to transfer the data to another device .


Cables and connectors

Types of cables ::
Twisted pair Cable
coaxial cable 
fibre optic cable


Router is a device that connects the LAN to the internet .

Modem : connects the computer to the internet over the exiting telephone line .

What is topology ?
Topology defines the structure of the network of how all the components are interconnected to each other .

Two types of topology : physical and logical 
BUS RING TREE STAR MESH HYBRID .

RING ::
topology is like a bus topology , but with connected ends .

Advantages >>
the posibility of collisions is minimum in this type of tepology .
cheap

Disadvantages >>
less secure
troubleshooting(form of problem solving)
additions of new devices can distrub other system 


TREE = BUS + star .
Hierarhical flow of data .

central hub fails the entire system fails .
cost is high because of cabling .

MESH : technology is an arrangement of the network in which computers are interconnected with each other through various redundant connections .
MESH :: 
NUmber of cables = (n*(n-1))/2 n :: no. of nodes that represent network .
Avantages : 
it is robust .
The fault is diagnosed easliy .
Provides security and privacy

Disadvantages >>>
installation and configuration is difficult .
cost of cables so required less devices .
THe cost of maintenance is high .

STAR ::
In star topology , all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable .
central Computer is an known as a server .
devices attached to the server are known as clients .
Efficient troubleshooting as compare to bus ring.

Advantages >>
N devices than N cables 
Easy to setup .

Disadvantages >>>
cost of installation is high .
all system relies on hub


BUS :: is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to a single cable .
backbone cable -> single cable
Advantages ::
1. Low-cost cable
2. Moderate data speeds :: 10Mbps
3, Familiar technology
4. LImited failure

Disadvantages ::
if the network traffic is heavy , it increases collisions in the network . To avoid this , various protocols are used in the MAC layer known CSMA?CD 
Extensive cabling
Difficult troubleshooting
Signal interference

IP (internet protocol address) is a numrical label such as 192.33.2.1 that is connected to a computer network that uses IP for communication .

IP address serves two main functions:
1. network interface identification and 2 . local addressing .

IPv4 32-bit NUmber address
IPv6 using 128 bits for the IP address . (since mid 2000s)
IPv6 increases the IP address from 32 bits to 132 bits to support larger address demands .

Port Number ::
A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer , thus ranging from 0 to 65535 .


structure of network ::

OSI Model Open Systems Interconnection .
