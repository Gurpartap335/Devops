OSI open systems Interconnection
It has been developed by ISO International Organization for standardization 1984 .

OSI model defines and is used to understand - How data is transferred from one computer to another in computer network ?

In order to accomplish successfull communication between computers or networks of different architectures , OSI model was introduced .

7 layer architecture 
all these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from person to another 
across the globe .

software layers ::
Application layer
Presentation layer
session layer

Heart of OSI::
Transport layer

Hardware layers ::
Network layer
Data link layer
Physical Layer .

Physical layer ::
It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices .

Application -> software

1. Physical Layer ::
lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer .
contains information in bits .

functions >
Bit synchronization
Bit rate control
Physical topologies
Transmission mode (various transmission modes possible are simplex , half duplex , full fuplex) .

HUB , Repeater , Modem , Cables are Physical Layer devices .

2. 
DATA LINK LAYER (DDL)
The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer  is error free from one node to another , over the physical layer .

functions >>
Framing 
Physical addressing
Error control
Flow control
Access control

Switch and Bridge are Data Link layer devices .

3. 
Network Layer 
The network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks .
it also takes care of packet routing .

Functions ::
Routing
Logical Addressing
