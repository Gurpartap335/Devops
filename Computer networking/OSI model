OSI open systems Interconnection
It has been developed by ISO International Organization for standardization 1984 .

OSI model defines and is used to understand - How data is transferred from one computer to another in computer network ?

In order to accomplish successfull communication between computers or networks of different architectures , OSI model was introduced .

7 layer architecture 
all these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from person to another 
across the globe .

software layers ::
Application layer
Presentation layer
session layer

Heart of OSI::
Transport layer

Hardware layers ::
Network layer
Data link layer
Physical Layer .

Physical layer ::
It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices .

Application -> software
1. Application layer : Network Applications likes that uses internet chrome firefox sykpe

Protocols
File transfer FTP 
web surfing  HTTP HTTPs
Emails SMTP
Virtual terminals Telnet

2. Presentation layer
Translation Data   Compression  Encryption/Decryption

3. Session layer
APIs Application Programming interface
NETBIOS Network Basic Input/output System
a. Session
b. Authentication : who are you ? username password 
c. Authorization

also check which files are being downloaded

4. Transport layer :
Segmentation
Flow control
server sending data 40mbps but we can download files 10mbps 
so transport layer tell server to slow down so data can not lost .

Error control ::

5. Network Layer
6. Data Link Layer
7. Physical layer
