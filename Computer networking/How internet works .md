## How does internet works ?
The internet is the backbone of the web, the technical infrastructure that makes the web possible.
Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together.

Internet is a way to connect computers all together and ensure that, whatever happens, they find a way to stay connected.

How does the internet works via cables ?

Data center
Optical fiber network
Server

IP address (internet protocol)
is a unique address that indentifies a device on the internet or
a local network .

To access the internet we use domain name (ex: facebook.com) instead of ip address .

DNS : Domain Name System

protocols


How does the internet work ?
**Internet simply is a wire .**

Every Server has unique IP address . 
*IP address helps computer find each other .*

We also give them names like google.com to easy to remember .
everything connected to internet has IP address .

computer we used are called clients bcz they are indirectly connected to internet through ISP.

computer breaks the information in small pieces called packets .

A simple network
when two computers need to communicate, you have to link them, either physically (usually with an Ethernet cable) or wirelessly (WiFi or bluetooth systems)

All modern computers can sustain any of those connections .

Special tiny computer called router.
router has only one job : like  a signaler at a railway station
it makes sure that a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right destination computer.

A network of networks

**The telephone infrastructure already connects your house with anyone in the world so it is the perfect wire we need. we use modem for this.**
Modem turns the information from our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.
The next step is to send the messages from our network to the network we want to reach. To do that, we will connect our network to ISP (internet service provider).

ISP Internet Service provider

**cables -> router -> router-router -> modem -> IPS**

Finding computer
IP address for ex. 142.250.190.78
IP address with a human readable name called a DOMAIN Name.

### Internet and the web
Internet is a technical infrastruture which allows billions of computers to be connected all together .
Among those computers, **some computers (called Web servers)** can send messages intelligble to web browsers.
web, email, irc are services built on infrastructure of internet.
IRC internet Relay chat.

### Intranet and Extranet

Intranet are private networks that are restrited to members of a particlur organization .

Extranets are very similar to intranets , except they open all or part of a network to allow sharing 
and collaboration with other organizations .

Internet(the world) -> Extranet(suppliers, customers, collaborators)-> Intranet(the compony only).
