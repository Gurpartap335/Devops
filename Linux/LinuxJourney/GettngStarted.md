1969 Unix operating system 
It was later written in C to make it more portable and eventually become a widely used operating system .

GNU : GNU is not UNIX (recursive acronym)

The kernel is the most important piece in the operating system .It allows
the hardware to talk to the software .

Then in 1991 , a young fellow named Linux Torvalds started developing what we now know 
today as the linux kernel .

GNU is an operating system that is free software i.e it respects users freedom .
Free Software : means software that respects users freedom and community .
Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute,
 study, change and improve the software. 

Chooaing a Linux Distribution :
Linux is actually quite a misnomer, since it actually refers to the Linux kernel .
many distribtion use the Linux kernel so therefore are commonly known as 
Linux operating systems .

Linux system is divided into three main parts :
Hardware : This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory , CPU , disks etc .

Linux kernel ;

User Space : this is where users like yourself will be directly interacting with the system .

Linux Mint : 
ligher distro than Ubuntu

Package management : mint is ubuntu based , it uses the debian package manager .

configurability : great user interface , less bloated than ubuntu .
